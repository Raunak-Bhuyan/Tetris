<h1>Tetris in Python</h1>
<h3>This is a classic Tetris game built using Python and Pygame. The objective is to rotate and place falling blocks (tetrominoes) to form complete horizontal lines, which then get cleared from the board. The game speeds up over time, challenging the playerâ€™s reflexes and planning skills. It's a fun way to explore game development with Python!
